## Introduction
This page outlines a our organization's development processes by adopting Agile methodologies, specifically implementing the Scrum framework to enhance team productivity, collaboration, and adaptability to changing requirements.

## Base Approach: Agile Methodology
Adopting Agile methodologies will address these challenges by promoting iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility.

### Agile Methodology
Agile is a project management approach focusing on flexibility, collaboration, customer feedback, and iterative progress.

#### Key Principles of Agile
1. **Customer Satisfaction**: Deliver valuable software early and continuously.
2. **Embrace Change**: Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
3. **Frequent Delivery**: Deliver working software frequently.
4. **Collaboration**: Developers and business people work together daily.
5. **Motivated Individuals**: Trust individuals to get the job done.
6. **Face-to-Face Conversation**: The most efficient communication method.
7. **Working Software**: The primary measure of progress.
8. **Sustainable Development**: Teams maintain a constant work pace.
9. **Technical Excellence**: Focus on technical excellence and good design.
10. **Simplicity**: Maximize the amount of work not done.
11. **Self-Organizing Teams**: Best architectures and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. **Reflection and Adjustment**: Regularly reflect and adjust for effectiveness.

### Scrum Framework
Scrum structures work into Sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks, promoting iterative progress and flexibility.

#### Roles
- **Product Owner**: Maximizes product value and manages the backlog.
- **Development Team**: Cross-functional team delivering a "Done" product increment.

#### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of user stories and requirements.
- **Sprint Backlog**: Tasks and user stories committed to in a Sprint.
- **Increment**: The sum of completed backlog items during a Sprint.

#### Events
- **Sprint Planning**: The team plans the Sprint's work.
- **Daily Scrum**: A short daily meeting to synchronize activities.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: The team reflects on improvements for the next Sprint.

## Proposed Solutions: How to Integrate Agile/Scrum Into Our Team

### Overall Plan - Product Backlog
A structured three-month planning cycle:
- Set deadlines for development, testing, and release.
- Plan features for the cycle and assign them to Sprints.
- Assign responsibilities and gather team members' availability.

### Demo Sessions - Sprint Retrospective and Planning
After each Sprint, hold demo sessions to gather feedback and discuss project progress.

### Reporting and Monitoring
- Daily reports to set tasks and results. This approach helps to monitor what we achieved and what blocked us for certain time period.
- Use GitHub activity for monitoring, encouraging small PRs and board use.
